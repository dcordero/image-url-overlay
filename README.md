# image-url-overlay

Image URL Overlay is a lightweight Firefox extension that displays an overlay on every image on a webpage, showing its source URL.

It supports responsive images (`<picture>`, `srcset`) and ensures the overlay always fits within the image boundaries. Ideal for developers, designers, and content auditors who need to quickly inspect image sources.
